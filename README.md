# rest-api

This is my first GitHub repository that I created without any groupmates. In this repository, I will use Java Spring Boot to create a REST API with functions like sign up or login.

#1- Added login endpoint.

#2- Added signup endpoint (The code didn't overwrite the previous one so I deleted it).
